# Sprite Stacking Project at GMS2

This is a project that demonstrates the use of **sprite stacking** — a technique that creates a 3D-like visual style using stacked 2D slices of voxel art.

## 🧊 What is Sprite Stacking?

Sprite stacking is a method where 2D images (slices) are layered vertically to simulate depth, often used to emulate voxel-like visuals in 2D engines. It's great for stylized games and retro aesthetics.

## 🛠️ How the Sprites Are Made

All the slice images used in this project are generated using [**MagicaVoxel**](https://ephtracy.github.io/) — a free voxel editor.

### Steps:
1. Create a voxel model in **MagicaVoxel**.
2. Rotate the model to the desired view (usually isometric or front-facing).
3. Export the model as a sequence of images using the *slice rendering* feature (use the **"slice"** tab in MagicaVoxel).
4. Load the image slices in your game or application, stacking them from bottom to top to form the 3D illusion.

## 💡 Use Cases

- Retro-style voxel games
- 2D games with 3D aesthetics
- Prototyping voxel objects in non-3D engines

## 🧰 Tools Used

- [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) – for creating and slicing voxel art
- [GameMaker Studio 2](gamemaker.io/) - game engine
